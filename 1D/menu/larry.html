		<h2><p class="text-secondary">LARRY STYLINSON (Louis Tomlinson + Harry Styles)</p></h2>
<img src="img/larry1.jpg">
<p> From the beginning, as soon as the band was formed, the great friendship between the two members of the band, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson was noticed. Even now many fans believe there was a <b> relationship</b> between the two, not just a simple friendship. In fact, there are a lot of romantic fanfics about them. Some people even think that Eleanor isn't really Louis's girlfriend. The good relationship between the two boys was noticed especially in the first years when the boys sang together. Then it is thought that due to the contract with <i> Modest!</i>, the company-manager of the band, the two were forced to break up. In fact in recent years the two were often cold to each other, they no longer touched, they no longer joked. </p>
